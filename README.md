## Billionaires Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis in R
This project demonstrates a quick Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow in R using a dataset of billionaires. It includes basic vector operations, subsetting, summary tables, and visualizations (bar chart and pie chart) by region.

## 📂 Data
File name: BILLION.TXT
Expected columns:
Wealth – net worth (in billions)
Age – age of the individual
Region – geographical region (e.g., "United States", "Europe", etc.)

## 🔍 Code Overview
1. Vector Operations
Basic indexing, filtering, and mathematical transformations to practice R syntax.

2. Data Subsetting
Examples of:
- Filtering billionaires by wealth threshold
- Selecting columns (Wealth, Age, Region)
- Creating subsets for specific regions (e.g., United States, Europe)

3. Summary Statistics
- Frequency table of billionaires by region
- Proportion table (percentage by region)
- Combined data frames with counts and percentages

4. Visualizations
- Bar Chart: Number of billionaires by region
- Pie Chart: Regional distribution in polar coordinates

## 📈 Conclusion
This analysis provides a high-level overview of global billionaire distribution by region, using a combination of summary statistics and visual exploration. The results highlight differences in billionaire counts across regions, reveal outliers, and offer a quick way to visualize wealth concentration. This kind of dataset can be further enriched with additional variables (e.g., industry, source of wealth) to perform deeper socio-economic and comparative studies.
